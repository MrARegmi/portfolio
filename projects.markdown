**Technologies: Solana, Rust, Anchor, React, Node.js**
As the founder and visionary behind The Timeless Tutor, I spearheaded the development of a revolutionary Web3 and AI-powered learning platform. This flagship project is at the forefront of innovation, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to create a secure, decentralized, and immersive educational experience.

Key Highlights:
- Designed and implemented a robust ecosystem of smart contracts on the Solana blockchain using Anchor, facilitating trustless accountability, transparency, and fair rewarding within the mentor-mentee relationships.
- Integrated a quantum-inspired AI algorithm for intelligent mentor-mentee matchmaking, optimizing compatibility and growth potential based on goals, strengths, weaknesses, learning styles, and personal interests.
- Pioneered the integration of Worldcoin sign-in, enabling secure and private access through blockchain-based identity verification, while minimizing personal data sharing.
- Developed interactive Web3 classrooms and learning modules, empowering learners worldwide to engage in decentralized education seamlessly.
- Won the prestigious ethGlobal 2023 hackathon, sponsored by WorldID, for our innovative approach to secure and decentralized education.

### Solana Blockchain Transaction Monitor
**Technologies: Rust, Solana Blockchain, WebSocket**

In a groundbreaking initiative aimed at enhancing transparency and efficiency within the Solana blockchain ecosystem, I developed a Solana Blockchain Transaction Monitor. This sophisticated tool leverages the power of Rust and WebSocket technology to provide real-time monitoring of transactions across the network.

Key Features:
- **Real-Time Transaction Monitoring**: Utilizes Solana's PubSub API over WebSockets to monitor transactions in real-time, ensuring up-to-the-second data accuracy and responsiveness.
- **Transaction Validation and Processing**: Integrates with the Solana RPC client to fetch detailed transaction information, allowing for comprehensive analysis and validation of each transaction as it occurs.
- **Advanced Token Tracking**: Implements logic to specifically track transactions involving the Render Token (`rndrizKT3MK1iimdxRdWabcF7Zg7AR5T4nud4EkHBof`), demonstrating the ability to filter and analyze transactions based on specific criteria.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Built with `tokio` for asynchronous execution, optimizing performance and resource utilization even under high transaction volumes.

This project not only underscores my proficiency in Rust and my deep understanding of blockchain technology but also exemplifies my commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with decentralized finance solutions. By providing a tool that enhances the visibility and analysis of blockchain transactions, I aim to contribute to the security, transparency, and efficiency of the Solana ecosystem.


### Quote Generation and Approval System for Manulife
**Technologies: Omnistudio , Apex**
In collaboration with developers from around the globe, I contributed to the development of a quote generation and approval system for Manulife. This project enhanced the insurance quote generation and approval process, enabling a more efficient and user-friendly experience for both clients and staff. The system has been successfully built and is currently in use, marking a significant improvement in Manulife's operational efficiency and customer service.

## Customer Support Portal
**Technologies: ReactJS, NodeJS**
Developed for GamerLink, this project involved building a customer support portal with features like paginated chat, moderation of activities, and optimized data handling using cache to reduce server load.

## Ayurveda Foundation Blood App
**Technologies: Java, Android Studio**
A blood donation app created for the Ayurveda Foundation to facilitate communication between donors and patients, featuring user authentication, real-time notifications, and a dynamic user interface.
