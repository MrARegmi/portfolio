In a testament to my dedication and rapid learning capabilities, I recently emerged victorious at the prestigious ethGlobal 2023 hackathon, sponsored by WorldID. This accomplishment not only underscores my talent but also highlights my unwavering commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements.

Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated a knack for quickly grasping complex concepts and applying them to real-world scenarios. My diverse skill set encompasses Python, deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow), web development (ReactJS, NodeJS, GraphQL, Django, Flask), databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), and project management methodologies like Agile, enabling me to tackle intricate challenges and deliver innovative solutions.

As you explore my portfolio, you will gain insights into my educational background, work experiences, innovative projects, and the ever-expanding repertoire of skills that fuel my passion for technology.
